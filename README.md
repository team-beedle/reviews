# Reviews

Team Beedle was tasked with building services to replace the backend of an existing ecommerce website. The goal was to minimize the impact to the frontend and design an API that is scalable, efficient and delivered significantly fast response times. 
- The Reviews service uses Nginx to cache and load balance requests across several service instances. 
- It also takes advantage of proper indexing. The result is a service that peaks at 5000 requests per second, or 600,000 a minute, with 12ms response times.
